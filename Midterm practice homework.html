      <p> Shoppers meandered through NorthPark Center. Some carried big red Macy’s bags that proclaimed, in bold white script, “Believe.” But Casen Hagans, 11, wasn’t sure he should.</p>
      <p>In line to see Santa Claus, Casen turned to his mother and quietly expressed concern.</p>
      <p> “You sure this is the real deal?”</p>
      <p> He’s in fifth grade, and in a few Christmases, he’ll be taller than his mother. His green-and-black striped sweater matched his little brother’s. The sleeves were just a little too long.</p>
      <p> Casen’s mother assured him this was, in fact, the Santa, while his 7-year-old brother and 9-year-old sister peeked around the corner to get a glimpse of the Big Man.</p>

       <p>Despite harboring doubts about whether he was the 'real deal,' 11-year-old Casen Hagans delivered this Christmas wish list to Santa Claus at NorthPark Center.</p>
      <p> Casen still had questions.</p>
      <p> Shouldn’t Santa be at his workshop at this time in December? How is he getting his work done? </p>
      <p> How does he get around the world in one night? Sure, he has flying reindeer, but still...</p>
      <p> A velvet rope was unclipped, and Casen stepped toward the man with the bushy white beard and twinkling blue eyes.</p>
      <p> Belief ... and bicycles</p>
      <p>This year, Casen wrote his list in red marker on a piece of white paper with a festive red-and-white border. He held it in his right hand while sitting next to Santa. He still had doubts — “about 50/50,” he would later say — but the old man’s warm smile and bright eyes conveyed a certain magic of their own.</p>
      <p> He asked for Texas Tech football tickets and a kicking tee, but what he really wants is a new bicycle, the grown-up kind with gears.</p>
      <p> Santa waved goodbye and wished the family a Merry Christmas. He carefully placed the letters from Casen and his siblings in a side table. Casen and his family ran off to continue their shopping at the Disney Store.</p>
      <p> As they walked away, Casen looked toward the sparkling sign outside Macy’s: “Believe.” He hoped Santa got the message: A bike with gears, please.</p>
